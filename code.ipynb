thoughts\\n\\np it was eyeopening actually i noticed that i have this recurring thought that im not good enough especially at work\\n\\nt thats a valuable insight lets explore that thought a little what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this belief\\n\\n0015  0025\\n\\np well i did get good feedback from my supervisor last week but i still feel like im just barely keeping up\\n\\nt its common to have these feelings it sounds like theres a discrepancy between your thoughts and some of the external feedback youre receiving how do you feel about that\\n\\np it makes me question why i doubt myself so much\\n\\n0025  0035\\n\\nt that questioning is a crucial part of cbt lets work on reframing that thought today instead of im not good enough what could you say that acknowledges your strengths and efforts\\n\\np maybe im competent and my supervisor values my work\\n\\nt excellent reframe how does stating it that way feel for you\\n\\np a bit more positive ill need to practice it though\\n\\n0035  0050\\n\\nt practice can make a big difference and remember if a particular thought keeps surfacing we can continue to explore and challenge it also i wanted to
