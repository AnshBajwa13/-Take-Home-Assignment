Story 2: Concern
## Video Quality Issues are Negatively Impacting Users

Analysis of feedback_analysis_79.txt, interview_transcripts_85.txt, product_metrics_81.txt, product_intelligence_report_87.txt, and user_journey_90.txt reveals concerns regarding video quality, particularly for users in rural areas. 40% indicate a negative impact on users.

This issue has led to increased frustration and decreased engagement among users.

Users have expressed 'The video keeps freezing during my sessions, making it difficult to connect with my therapist' and 'I'm in a rural area, and the video quality is so unreliable that I often have to switch to audio-only' about this problem.

To address this concern, it is recommended to optimize the app's performance, improve navigation, and provide clearer instructions.

# During the development process, I encountered rate limiting issues with the OpenAI API, which limited my ability to generate a large number of stories. To mitigate this, I optimized my code to reduce API calls and focused my analysis on a carefully selected subset of the data. With more API access, I could further expand the system and explore different story generation approaches.

Analysis of Story Quality

Structure: The stories generally follow the expected structure with headlines, summaries, and other relevant sections.
Clarity: The narratives are mostly clear and concise, although some could benefit from further refinement.
Data-driven: The stories incorporate data points and references to support the claims.
Actionability: The recommendations are generally actionable, although some could be more specific.

Performance Metrics

Since we haven't explicitly defined performance metrics in the code, we can focus on qualitative observations:

Story type classification: The story type classification seems to be mostly accurate based on the initial set of stories.
LLM performance: The LLM (ChatGPT) seems to be performing reasonably well in extracting topics and generating summaries, although further evaluation is needed with a larger set of stories.
