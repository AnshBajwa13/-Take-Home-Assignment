Story 1: Win
## Positive Outcomes and High Engagement in Teen Therapy

85%, 92%, 15%, 90%, 75% highlight the success of teen therapy in feedback_analysis_1.txt, interview_transcripts_8.txt, product_metrics_4.txt, product_intelligence_report_10.txt, and user_journey_13.txt. User feedback indicates 'The new onboarding process is much smoother and more intuitive,' and 'I feel like the app really understands my needs now'.

This success can be attributed to the user-friendly interface, personalized content, and effective communication tools.

This positive outcome has resulted in increased user satisfaction, higher engagement rates, and improved clinical outcomes.

Users have expressed 'The new onboarding process is much smoother and more intuitive,' and 'I feel like the app really understands my needs now' about this feature.

To maintain and further enhance this success, it is recommended to continue gathering user feedback, expand the platform's reach, and explore new features based on user needs.

Story 2: Concern
## Video Quality Issues are Negatively Impacting Users

Analysis of feedback_analysis_79.txt, interview_transcripts_85.txt, product_metrics_81.txt, product_intelligence_report_87.txt, and user_journey_90.txt reveals concerns regarding video quality, particularly for users in rural areas. 40% indicate a negative impact on users.

This issue has led to increased frustration and decreased engagement among users.

Users have expressed 'The video keeps freezing during my sessions, making it difficult to connect with my therapist' and 'I'm in a rural area, and the video quality is so unreliable that I often have to switch to audio-only' about this problem.

To address this concern, it is recommended to optimize the app's performance, improve navigation, and provide clearer instructions.

# During the development process, I encountered rate limiting issues with the OpenAI API, which limited my ability to generate a large number of stories. To mitigate this, I optimized my code to reduce API calls and focused my analysis on a carefully selected subset of the data. With more API access, I could further expand the system and explore different story generation approaches.


Analysis of Story Quality

Structure: The stories generally follow the expected structure with headlines, summaries, and other relevant sections.
Clarity: The narratives are mostly clear and concise, although some could benefit from further refinement.
Data-driven: The stories incorporate data points and references to support the claims.
Actionability: The recommendations are generally actionable, although some could be more specific.

Performance Metrics

Since we haven't explicitly defined performance metrics in the code, we can focus on qualitative observations:

Story type classification: The story type classification seems to be mostly accurate based on the initial set of stories.
LLM performance: The LLM (ChatGPT) seems to be performing reasonably well in extracting topics and generating summaries, although further evaluation is needed with a larger set of stories.
